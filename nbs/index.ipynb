I have setup **Ubuntu, sudo, default user, conda, jupyter, cuda, pytorch, fastai** in the base image. Please, check the [README](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kushaj/fastai/) for the complete details of the base image.\n",

    "* `-p 8889:8889` - format is {host_port}:{container_port}. This is used to run the jupyter notebook. \n",
    "* `--ipc=host` - PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g. for multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough and using `--ipc=host` resolves this issue.\n",
